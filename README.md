## 👋 Hi there! 

I'm Jason Lee, a passionate Software Programmer dedicated to creating utilities that make your life easier. You'll find a collection of my work over at my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/themanlee7942/utils).

### 🛠️ What I Do

I develop a variety of utilities designed to streamline your workflow, enhance productivity, and solve real-world problems. All of my code is open-source and free to use.

### 🙏 Why Support Me

While I love programming and sharing my utilities with the community, it does require a significant investment of time and resources. Your support will help me to continue developing, maintain the code, and bring new features to life.

### ☕ How to Support

If you've found my utilities useful, consider buying me a coffee! Your donation, no matter how small, will go a long way in helping me keep the code coming.

### 🙌 Thank You

I deeply appreciate your support and am thrilled to have you as part of this journey. Your contribution makes all the difference!
